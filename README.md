Day 5 of Python
This repository contains beginner-level Python scripts created on the fifth day of learning Python. Each file demonstrates core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, input/output, and basic algorithmic thinking.

Files Description
fizz_buzz.py
A classic FizzBuzz challenge that prints numbers from 1 to 100, substituting "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
highest_score_in_the_class.py
Finds the highest score from a list of student scores using loop-based comparison logic.
loop_for.py
Demonstrates basic usage of for loops with different data types such as strings and lists.
loop_for_range.py
Explores the range() function in for loops to control iteration over a sequence of numbers.
password_generator.py
Generates random passwords based on user-defined counts of letters, symbols, and numbers. Includes both easy (ordered) and hard (shuffled) password generation.
students_height.py
Calculates the average height from a list of student heights entered by the user, using loops and arithmetic operations.
